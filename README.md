# IMPORTANT

I'm NOT a *nix dev. All I wanted is to fork apnadkarni's great work to make Tk see system fonts. In progress...

# Only Linux Builds

Only 64-bit Tcl 9 builds for Linux here, since for Windows the amazing [Magicsplat's Tcl/Tk 9 installer](https://www.magicsplat.com/tcl-installer/) is available, and I highly recommend it. As for Mac, you can try MacPorts, maybe they have Tcl9 available.
