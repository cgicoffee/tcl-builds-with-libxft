# IMPORTANT

I'm NOT a *nix dev. All I wanted is to fork apnadkarni's great work to make Tk see system fonts. In progress...

[Here's the original repo](https://github.com/apnadkarni/tcl-builds)

# Only Linux Builds

Only 64-bit Tcl 9 builds for Linux here, since for Windows the amazing [Magicsplat's Tcl/Tk 9 installer](https://www.magicsplat.com/tcl-installer/) is available, and I highly recommend it.

Copyright and everything belong to the original author, I just forked it to make it play nice with OS fonts.
